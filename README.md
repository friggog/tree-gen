# tree-gen

Blender plugin produced as part of my undergraduate dissertation: [Procedural generation of tree models for use in computer graphics](https://chewitt.me/Papers/CTH-Dissertation-2017.pdf).

Thanks to the awesome work of [Luke Pflibsen-Jones](https://github.com/lukepfjo) you can install the zip through the Blender addon UI (or drop the extracted folder into your blender addons directory) and enable the plugin in user settings to start generating trees - now with a complete customisation UI! 

Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/friggog/tree-gen/releases).

(WIP) Docmentation is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/friggog/tree-gen/wiki).

The code is under GPL-3.0 License, any models generated using the tool are free for use without restriction in any context apart from direct sale as assets.
