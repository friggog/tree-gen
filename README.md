# tree-gen
Blender plugin produced as part of my undergraduate dissertation: [Procedural generation of tree models for use in computer graphics](https://chewitt.me/Papers/CTH-Dissertation-2017.pdf).

Thanks to the awesome work of [Luke Pflibsen-Jones](https://github.com/luketimothyjones) you can just drop the `ch_trees` folder into your blender addons folder and enable the plugin in user settings to start generating trees - now with a complete customisation UI! 

Download the latest version (for blender 2.8) [here](https://github.com/friggog/tree-gen/archive/master.zip). The 2.79 version of the plugin is available [here](https://github.com/friggog/tree-gen/archive/blender-279.zip).

(WIP) Docmentation is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/friggog/tree-gen/wiki).
